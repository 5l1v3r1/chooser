## About
Repository containing the source code for the new Creative Commons License Chooser.

This site is built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Buefy](https://buefy.org/), and [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

## Getting Started

# Builds and serves assets with hot-reload
